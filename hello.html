<h1><b>Book Worms Unite</b></h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>"You enter a new world every time you open a book"</i>, Kiersten Fay.
    For many book lovers this rings true. I find there is not much better than opening a book to read and being transported into another world. Some worlds may be fantasy, or sci-fi or dystopian. You may find yourself in a world of horror, suspense or adventure. Perhaps you will fall into a world full of love and romance and more. Whatever book you pick up is sure to take you somewhere new. Enjoy the escape and the thrill of meeting new characters whom you will grow to love (or not) and envision yourself in a setting you wish you could visit in real life. Books are powerful, they are friends through good and bad times. Reading books is this book worms favorite activity.</p>
