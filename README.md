I am a student in a full stack MITxPro web development program and we were asked to create a website that included a photo and an ordered list and unordered list. I plan to add more CSS to this website and change it up more in the future.

Skills I used in the projec:
1. Creating an html based code
2. Adding text style and changing sizes
3. Sourcing and sizing an image to be on the website
4. Adding an external link into the code
5. Creating two ordered lists
6. Creating an unordered list with external links
